This is the final one: fetch downloads the objects, makes the repository aware of how many commits you are behind the remote
But git log will only show the same commits as before the fetch -but you can checkout the new (not merked) commits - but it will be as DETACHED HEAD!
OF WITH THE HEAD
Oh - this was not the final after all....
